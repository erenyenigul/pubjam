# pubjam 🎸 : a song request app for restaurants, cafes and bars!

* generates qr codes for tables 🥂 
* using these qr codes customers can make song requests 🎤
* requests are queued automatically (no worries, there is explicit song filter) 

This is the frontend of the application which is using React.js ⚛️. It is not possible to run the app without its backend. You can clone the backend from [here](https://github.com/erenyenigul/pubjam-backend).

Update: the backend is currently not publicly available. If you want to access it, please reach me from my [email](mailto:erenyenigul@gmail.com).
